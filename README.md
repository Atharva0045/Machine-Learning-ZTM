# Machine Learning ZTM 🎯

Welcome to my **Machine Learning** repository! This repo contains all the notebooks and projects I completed as part of the **Zero to Mastery Machine Learning and Deep Learning Bootcamp**. This course is packed with foundational machine learning concepts, practical projects, and advanced techniques using popular libraries like **scikit-learn** and **TensorFlow**.

## 📑 Course Outline

The repository covers the following topics:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing data, encoding categorical variables, feature scaling, and splitting datasets.
2. **Supervised Learning**: Regression and classification models such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, ROC Curves, and Confusion Matrices.
5. **Deep Learning**: Implementing neural networks using TensorFlow and Keras.
6. **Advanced Topics**: Transfer Learning, Natural Language Processing, and more.

## 🛠 Tools and Libraries

- **Python**
- **scikit-learn**
- **TensorFlow**
